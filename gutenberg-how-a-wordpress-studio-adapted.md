# [fit] Gutenberg
# [fit] How a WordPress studio adapted

## **By David Darke**

---

# [fit] How we started

---

---

## When we began, we used...

---

# [fit] ... a custom CMS

<br>

# [fit] 🤮🤯😱💀😵🤢

---

# [fit] How about... WordPress?

---

![fit](assets/wp3.0_post.png)

---

# [fit] WordPress delivered:

- Simple and reliable content delivery
- Clear page hierarchy / URL structure
- Simple menu system
- Basic media library

---

# [fit] There were limitations

---

---

# [fit] ACF allowed us

- Easily create robust fieldsets
- Build post to post relationships
- Fashion basic event system / queries
- Build a block / page building system

---

# [fit] Next challenge:
# [fit] Build a more flexible
# [fit] content editor

---

---

# This was great, but keeping fields in sync between development and production was **PAINFUL!**

---

# [fit] Then ACF Pro added JSON support

![inline](assets/mind-blown.gif)

---

# [fit] Why is that feature so important?

![inline](assets/acf-json.png)

---

## This was the foundation of our internal development framework

---

# Then...

# [fit] Gutenberg was announced

![inline](assets/sweat.gif)

---

- Initial commit 3rd Feb 2017.
- Months rolled past.
- Beta versions and release candidates appeared.
- Sounded great, but we were worried about the impact on our day-to-day.

---

# The pitch

Gutenberg looks at the editor as more than a content field, revisiting a layout that has been largely unchanged for almost a decade. This allows us to holistically design a modern editing experience and build a foundation for things to come.

## [fit] 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

---

# The reception...

![inline](assets/1stars.png)

## [fit] 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎

---

# [fit] But why?

---

# Initial problems and some loss of confidence

- Releases were buggy
- A sense of this change being forced on a community
- No real clarity around the classic editor plugin and even how reliable it would be
- The negative voices outweighed positive

---

# [fit] Deeper reasons

---

# [fit] **Technical changes**

# Widely used frameworks would be affected

# [fit] **Another reason, Client relationships**

- How to discuss this big change to their precious website?
 - Some clients will like the update, some won't.
- Will there be problems?
- How long will it take to sort?


# Clients want a solid plan.

---

# [fit] First steps for Atomic Smash

- Composer helped us... A LOT
 - It allowed us to fix the core version and pre-load the classic editor
- Pre Xmas 2018 we updated a couple of sites to 5.0 (with classic editor installed)
 - Released December 6th, 2018 (Atomic Smash holiday started on the 19th)

# [fit] Studio is closed for two weeks at Xmas...

# [fit] What we did at Atomic Smash

- Composer helped us... ALOT
- Pre Xmas 2018 we updated a couple of sites
- **Post Xmas 2018 we updated the rest**

---

# Next, future planning

### - Review on a case by case basis whether the client needs/wants the update
### - All **new** project will use Gutenberg

# Prepping for a new testing process

# [fit] Block Unit Test for Gutenberg

# ACF is helping again, in the form of ACF blocks

# In Summary

- We entirely believe Gutenberg is the future of WordPress
    - But for right now, that doesn't mean it's for everyone
- The ecosystem around it is growing
- Stay flexible
